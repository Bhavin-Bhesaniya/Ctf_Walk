Security Frameworks :-
 - Blueprints for identifying and managing risks and weakness in organization system
 - Define policy and procedures that orgranization should follow to establish and manage security controls
 - Used to understand attacker
 
 National Institute Of Standards and Technology(NIST) Cybersecurity Framework :- Identify -> Protect -> Detect -> Respond -> Recover
 

 International Organization of Standardization(ISO) 27000 Series :-
  - Develop series of frameworks for different industries and sector
  - 27001 and 27002 procedures for creating, implementing and managing Information security management system(ISMS)
  - Assess organization to set information security requirement through application of risk management
 


 MITRE ATT-CK(Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Attack Framework :-
  - Identifying adversary plans of attack by understood method, tools and strategies established for attack known as Tactics, Techniques and Procedures(TTPs)
  - Gives details information about Attack Pattern





Cyber Kill Chain :-
 - Developed by Lockheed Martin that Described structure and Stages of attack
 Seven Stages :- Recon -> Weaponization -> Delivery -> Exploitation -> Installtion -> Command & Control -> Action on objective
  



Unified Kill Chain(UKC) :-
 - Unified Kill Chain can be described as unification of MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain framework
 - Published by Paul pols in 2017 and reviewed in 2022
 - Describes 18 phases of attack based on Tactics, Techniques and Procedures(TTP)
 

 Cycle-1 :- IN -> gain access to a system
  Reconnaissance     :- Research on target using publicly available information
  Weaponisation      :- Setup needed infrastructure to host Command and Control centre(C2) to executing attack
  Delivery           :- Payloads/Malicious instrument delivered to target such as Phishing Email and Supply Chain attack
  Social Engineering :- Trick target to performing untrusted and unsafe action against payload they just deliverd, often appear to come from trusted in-house source
  Exploitation       :- Find existing vulnerability may use this to trigger their payload
  Persistence        :- Leave on network to make sure they have point of access to their target
  Defence Evasion    :- Remain anonymous throughout exploits by disabling and avoiding security defence mechanisms including deleting evidence of their presence
  Command & Control  :- Communication channel between compromised system and attacker infrastructure establish across internet
 
 
 Cycle-2 :- Through -> Gain more access and privileges
  Pivoting    :- Compromised System become attack launchpad for other system in network
  Discovery   :- Gather as much information about compromised system such as available users and data
  Privilege Escalation :- Seek higher privileges on compromised system by exploiting identified vulnerabilities or misconfiguration
  Execution         :- With Elevated privileges, malicious code maybe downloaded and executed to extract sensitive info
  Credential Access :- login credentials stored in the hard disk or memory so get it from there
  Lateral Movement  :- Move around different system or data storage within network 
  
 
 Cycle-3 :- OUT -> CIA assets services compromised during phase
  Collection    :- Jackpot of information such as PII
  ExFilteration :- Ensure they have achieved their objectives without triggering suspicion
  Impact        :- Use all acquired privileges to manipulate, interrupt and sabotage | Financial and social damage organisation would have to recover from
  Objectives    :-   
   
    
 


Question and Answer :-
 1. Who is the adversary that attacked Santa's network this year? -> The Bandit Yeti
 2. What's the flag that they left behind?                        -> THM{IT'S A Y3T1 CHR1$TMA$}
