Packet :-
 - Basic unit of network data transferred over network from one host to another
 - Process of extracting, assessing and identifying network patterns such as connections, shares, 
   commands and other network activities, like logins, and system failures, from the prerecorded 
   traffic files known as Packet Analysis
 - Network traffic pure and rich data source
 - Packet Capture (PCAP) of network events provides rich data source for analysis
 - Threat detection and real-time performance troubleshooting cannot be done without packet analysis

 Point to consider :-
  Network and standard protocols knowledge
  Familiarity with attack and defence concepts
  Practical experience in analysis tools

 Things to Consider :-
  Hypothesis - Know what to look for before starting an analysis
  Statistics - Show weight of traffic in capture file
  Known Service - 
   - Everyday operations like web browsing, file sharing and mailing
   - Which protocol associated with which Service
  Unknown Service - Potential Red Flags | Known howto research and quickly use them 
  Known Patterns  
  Environments


WireShark :-
 - Network protocol analysis and is essential in any traffic and packet investigation
 - Statistics --> Protocol Hierarchy
 - Statistics --> Conversations
 - DNS -> Follow -> UDP Stream(Same for others)
 - Filter HTTP packet
 - Source is the Machine Which is the host that Downloads the File in this Case!!
 - Right Click on the Packet that uses GET Request to mysterygift.exe and click Follow → http Stream
 - Right-click on the Packet of Non-executable File and Follow the http stream
 - File→Export Objects-> HTTP  | Now open Terminal and Type the Command :- sha256sum mysterygift.exe
 - VIrus total -> Behaviour tab and Scroll below to Find IP
