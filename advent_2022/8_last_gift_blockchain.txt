- Best Festival Company lost all its currency in the exchange because of the attack. 


BlockChain :-
 - Act as database to store information in specified format and is shared among members of network with no one
   entity in control
 - Digital database distributed among nodes of a peer-to-peer network so there is no central server hence
   "Decentralized"
 - Each peer maintain integrity of blockchain
 - If one member modify blockchain maliciously, other compare it to their blockchain for integrity
  


Smart Contract :-
 - Smart contract is a program stored on a blockchain that runs when pre-determined conditions are met.
 - All blockchain rely on technology known as Smart Contract
 - Used as Backbone of "Decentralized Finance applications" to support cryptocurrency on blockchain
 - Defi facilitate currency exchange between entities;
 - Scripting Language used such as Rust, Javascript, Solidity, Vyper and YUL to create contract
 
 
 Functionality :-
  - Use with OOPS
  - Smart contract fields or information should be private and only accessed or modified from functions defined
    in the contract
  - Contract function such as accessors and mutators act as balance, depositing, and currency withdrawing
  - Once contract deployed on blockchain another contract use its function to call or execute
    
 
 Vulnerability in Smart Contract :-
  - Due to logic issues or poor exception handling  
  - Conditions are insecurely implemented
  - Recall contract consecutively to makes new calls to function while old is executing

 
 Re-entrancy Attack :-
  - Malicious contract use fallback function to continue depleting contract's total balance due to flawed 
    logic after an initial withdraw function occurs 
 
 
Remix IDE :-
 - file explorer → default_workspace → load a local file into the current workspace
 - .sol files to be imported
 - EtherStore.sol | Attack.sol
 - Compile contract -> Navigate to solidity compiler
