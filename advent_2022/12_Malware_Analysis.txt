Malware :-
 - software created to harm a computer or an entire network

 Network connections :-
  Internal :- lateral movement,technique used to extend access to other host or application within network
  External :- Allow remote access or for downloading staged payloads from a threat actors

 Registry Key Modifications :-
  - Uses registry keys to establish persistent 
  - Maintain long-term access to system despite disruptions
  Ex :- Registry Run Key :- Allow binaries to be automatically executed when user logs in or machine boots

 File Manipulation :-  


Handling malware sample dangerous :-
 - Executing it is not always the first and only step in analysing it
 - Run malware sample in controlled environment that prevents potential compromise of unwanted asset
 - Use Sandbox, which allows you have worry-free execution of malware samples
 
 Sandbox :- Gives analysts safe environment to execute malware samples and learn their behaviour
  

Static and Dynamic Analysis :-
 Static :-
  - Analysing malware sample without executing code
  - Focus on profiling binary with its readable information, such as its properties, flow and string
  - Not executing it, sometimes gives insufficient information

 Dynamic :- Understanding the malware by executing it in a safe environment(Sandbox)


Tools :-
 Detect It Easy :-
  - Provide information about file, such as its architecture, headers, packer and strings
  - Packing malware common technique used by malware developers to compress, obfuscate or encrypt binary
  - With this, content such as significant string and header not immediately visible to Static Analysis
    Tools  

 CAPA :- 
  - Shows that the binary mostly hides its logic and analysis is affected due to a packer
  - Detects capabilities in executable files
  
  T - capa filename
  T - upx -d filename (Upx packed that detect in DetectItEasy software)
  T - Baki
