Memory Forensics :-
 - Analysis of volatile memory that use when computer is powered on 
 - RAM remember what being performed on computer at the time 
 - RAM extremely quick and is the preferred method of storing and accessing data 
 - It is Limited so that data store is volatile because it will be deleted when computer is powered off
 - RAM stores data such as your clipboard or unsaved files
 - Analyse memory to see what application(processes), what network connection were being made and many more
   useful pieces of information 
 - Memory dump is full capture of what was happening on Computer at the time
 - Malicious code hide from users but cannot hide from memory
 


Process :-
 - Process is program in running execution
 User Process - Start by User like notepad.exe
 Background   - Managed by OS like dwn.exe(Display windows and application on computer)
 
 
 
Volatility :-
 - Open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python
 - Analyse memory dumps taken from Windows, Linux and Mac OS
 - List all processes that were running on the device at the time of the capture
 - python3 vol.py -h
 
 Common command option :-
  -f  - Provide name and location of the memory dump that you wish to analyse
  -v  - Increases verbosity of Volatility
  -p  - Override the default location of where plugins are stored
  -o  - specify where extracted processes or DLLs are stored
 
 imageinfo - Plugin to analyse our memory dump file to determine OS
  T - python3 vol.py -f workstation.vmem windows.info
  
 - We confirmed that OS is windows now use windows sub-set of plugins with Volatility

 windows.pslist - lists all of the processes at that were running at the time of the capture
 windows.psscan - To discover what a specific process was actually doing
 windows.dumpfiles - Export specific binary for further analyse through static or dynamic analysis
 windows.netstat   - Lists all network connection at the time of the capture
 
 T - python3 vol.py -f workstation.vmem windows.info
 T - python3 vol.py -f workstation.vmem windows.pslist
 T - python3 vol.py -f workstation.vmem windows.dumpfiles --pid 2040
