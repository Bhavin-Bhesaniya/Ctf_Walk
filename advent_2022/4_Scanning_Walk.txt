Scanning :-
 - Set of procedures for identifying live hosts, ports, and services, discovering os of target system, and
   identifying vulnerabilities and threats in network 
 - Reveals parts of attack surface from which attacker exploit system
 
 Types :-
  Passive :- 
   - Scanning network without directly interacting with target device 
   - Done through Packet Capture(WireShark)
   - Give basic asset information like OS Version, Network Protocol etc..
  
  Active :-
   - Scan individual endpoints to retrieve information
   - Sending packets or queries directly to specific assets rather than passively collecting that data by
     "catching" it in transit     
   - Targets can be single endpoint or network of endpoints
 


Scanning Techniques :-
 Network :- 
  - Collection of interconnected hosts or computers to share information and resources
  - Helps to discover and map complete network, including any live computer or hosts, open ports, IP addresses, 
    and services running on any live host and os
  - Once network mapped, attacker executes exploits as per target system and services discovered
   Ex :- Outdated apache version 
 
 
 Port Scanning :-
  - Port is a number assigned to uniquely identify connection endpoint and to direct data to specific service
  - At Software level, Within OS, port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of
    network service
  - Method to examine open ports in network that capable of receiving and sending data 
  - Port number varies between 0 to 65,536
  
  Closed Port :- Host is not listening to specific port
  Open Port   :- Host actively accept connection on specific port
  Filterd Port:- Port is open, but not accepting connections as it open for specific IP Address only
  
 
 Vulnerability Scanning :-
  - Identifies vulnerability in automated way that helps to determine whether system thretened or exploited
  - Free-paid tools helps to identify system vulnerability through Pre-build database
  Tools :- Nessus | Acunetix
 
   
  


Scanning TOols :-
 Nmap :-
  - Used to carry out port scanning, discover network protocols, identify running services, and detect operating
    systems on live hosts
 
 Nikto :-
  - Open-source software that allow scanning websites for vulnerability
  - Looking for subdomains, outdated servers, debug message
  Ex :- nikto -host machine_ip
  
  
  
Practical :- 
 - nmap -A 10.10.9.190 -oN nmap_result.txt
 - GO inside attack box and login with :- smb://10.10.9.190 | Id :- Ubuntu | Password :- S@nta2022
 - Admin -> USer.txt -> Password.txt


 
GO
