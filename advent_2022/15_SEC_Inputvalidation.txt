Unrestricted File Uploads usually have two main exploitation paths :-
 - If attacker can retrieve the uploaded file, it could lead to code execution if the attacker uploads 
   file such as a web shell
 - If the file is viewed by a user, think of a CV application, then an attacker could embed malware 
   in the uploaded file that would execute on the user's workstation once they view the file


When a resource is requested web server will first execute some instructions found in these pages 
before sending the compiled response back to the user. 

- If we can upload anyfile like aspx webshell and if this files stored in webroot, we could request file
  from server 
- Forceing server to process file before sending the compiled response
- However if stored outside webroot, cannot make request but this protection not sufficient
 1. Other vulnerabilities, such as local file inclusion,
 2. Rather than targeting web server directly, we could target the users
