Phases of Unified Kill Chain, Security framework used to understand attacker



Security Frameworks :-
 - Improve security posture of orgranization
 - Documented process that define policy and procedures that orgranization should follow to establish and
   manage security controls
 - Blueprints for identifying and managing risks and weakness in system
 


NIST(National Institute Of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework :-
 - Focus on Five Stages :- Identify -> Protect -> Detect -> Respond -> Recover
 


International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 27000 Series :-
 - Develop series of frameworks for different industries and sector
 - 27001 and 27002 procedures for creating, implementing and managing Information security management system (ISMS)
 - Assess organization ability to set information security requirement through application of risk management
 


MITRE ATT-CK(Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Attack Framework :-
 - Identifying adversary plans of attack by understood method, tools and strategies established for attack
   known as Tactics, Techniques and Procedures(TTPs)
 - Gives details information about Attack Pattern



Cyber Kill Chain :-
 - Described structure of an attack that commenly used as framework as part of intelligence-driven defence
 - Developed by Lockheed Martin
 
 Seven Stages :- 
  Recon -> Weaponization -> Delivery -> Exploitation -> Installtion -> Command & Control -> Action on objective
  


Unified Kill Chain(UKC) :-
 - Santaâ€™s team left with clue on who might have attacked them and pointed out to Unified Kill Chain (UKC)
 - Elf blue team beign research
 - Unified Kill Chain can be described as the unification of the MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain framework
 - Published by Paul pols in 2017 and reviewed in 2022
 - UKC describes 18 phases of attack based on TTP
 

 Cycle-1 :- IN -> gain access to a system
  Reconnaissance :- Research on target using publicly available information
  Weaponisation  :- Setting up needed infrastructure to host command and control centre(C2) to executing attack
  Delivery :- Payloads/Malicious instruments delivered to target such as email phishing and supply chain attack
  Social Engineering :- 
   - Trick target to performing untrusted and unsafe action against payload they just delivered, often making
     their message appear to come from trusted in-house source
  Exploitation :- Find existing vulnerability in assets, they may use this to trigger their payload
 
  Persistence :- Leave on network to make sure they have point of access to their target
  Defence Evasion :- Remain anonymous throughout their exploits by disabling and avoiding any security defence
   		     mechanisms enabled, including deleting evidence of their presence.
  Command & Control: Communication channel between compromised system and attacker infrastructure establishe
                     across internet
 
 
 Cycle-2 :- Through -> Gain more access and privileges
  Pivoting :- system will become the attack launchpad for other systems in the network
  Discovery:- Gather as much information about compromised system such as available users and data
  Privilege Escalation :- Seek higher privileges on compromised system by exploiting identified vulnerabilities or 		 	 misconfiguration
  Execution :- With elevated privileges, malicious code may be downloaded and executed to extract sensitive info
  Credential Access :- login credentials stored in the hard disk or memory
  Lateral Movement  :- Move around different system or data storage within network 
  
 
 Cycle-3 :- OUT -> CIA assets services compromised during phase
  Collection :- Jackpot of information such as PII
  ExFilteration :- Ensure they have achieved their objectives without triggering suspicion
  Impact -> Objectives :-  
   
    
 Puzzle :- Flag(THM{IT'S A Y3T1 CHR1$TMA$})
