Santaâ€™s Security Operations Center (SSOC) :-
 - Web server "santagift.shop" hijacked by Bandit Yeti APT group
 - Advanced persistent threat (APT) stealthy threat actor, typically nation state or state-sponsored group, 
   which gains unauthorized access to computer network and remain undetected for extended period
 
 Task :- Elf McBlue to analyse log files of server



What is log files and why they useful :-
 - Contain historical records of events and other data from application
 - Login attempts or failure 
 - Traffic on network
 - Thing like website url, files accessed
 - Password changes
 - Application error(Used in Debugging)
 
 - It important as pieces of evidence that :-
  1. What, When and Where happend?
  2. Who did it? Is it successful? 
  3. What is result of action?
  
  
 What log files content :-
  1. Event timestamp(Ex :-Date & Time)
  2. Service name that generating logfile(Ex :- SSH that allows user to login into a system remotely)
  3. Actual event service log (Ex :- In event of fail authentication, what credentials tried and by whom?(IP) 
 
 
 Common log file location :-
  Windows :- Built-in Event-Viewer 
   Application :-	
    - Contain all events related to application on system
    - You determine when service or application stopped and started and why
    
 
   Security :-	
    - Contain all events related to system security 
    - You can see when user logs into system or access credential manager for passwords	
    
 
   Setup :-	 
    - Contain all events related to system maintenance 
    Ex :- 
     - Windows update logs stored here	
     - System must restarted before "KB10134" can be installed
     
     
   System :- 
    - Events related to system itself like changes in system itself 
    Ex :- 
     - System powered on or off or when device such as USB drives are plugged-in or removed	
     - System unexpectedly shutdown due to power issue
    
  
  Linux(Ubuntu/Debian) :-
   - Log files are Software specific located within /var/log directory
   - ls -lah in /var/log
   
   Authentication :- auth.log
    - usually attempted either remotely or on the system itself
    - Accessing another user after logging in
   
   
   Package Management :- dpkg.log
    - When installing new software(package), logged in this file
    - Useful for reverting and debugging changes incase installtion cause unintended behaviour on system
    
   
   Syslog :- syslog
    - Contain all event that happening in system background
    - crontabs executing service such as log rotation
   
   
   Kernel :- kern.log
    - Change in kernel or output from device such as networking equipment or physical device such as USB device
    - Firewalling registered
    
 
  
 Look in log files / Log Analysis :-
  Tools :- Splunk | Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  
  
  SIEM :- 
   - Dedicated but expensive to run | Collect wide variety logs but takes time to configure and setup
   - Allow in-depth analysis at once but require proper knowledge to use
  
  
  grep :- 
   - Searching for given text in file   
   - grep will first assume file in your current directory unless tell it otherwise by providing file path
   
   -i :- Perform case insensitive search
   -E :- Searches using regex | 
   -r :- Search recursively | search all of files in directory for this value
  
  
  
  
 
Deploy Machine :-

ssh elfmcblue@10.10.84.125
