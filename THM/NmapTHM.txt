First Stage - Port Scanning 
 - Run network service, it open networking construct called “port” to receive connection
 - Necessary for making Connection to access service and make remote connection
 - Open port listening on server and randomly selected port on own computer
 - HTTP - 80 | HTTPS - 443 | NetBIOS - 139 | SMB - 445
 

Nmap :-
 - How port respond based on that Open, Closed or Filtered(Usually by firewall)
 Syntax :- nmap [Scan Type] [Options] [Target]
 
 Target :-
  - Can pass hostname(rru.ac.in), IP address(192.168.10.1), Networks 
  -iL :- Input file that contain list of Host
  -iR :- Choose random host
  --exclude     <Host1,Host..n> | --excludefile <file>           
 
 
 SCAN :-
   -sS :- TCP SYN
   -sT :- Connect
   -sU :- UDP Scan
   -sN :- Null scan
   -sF :- Fin
   -sX :- Xmas
   -sO :- IP Protocol Scan
   -sV :- Version info
   -sC :- Script Scan
   -PO :- Protocol List
   -O  :- Enable OS detection
   -p  :- Only scan specified ports  | -p port | -p startport-endport | -p-
   -F  :- Scan default port scan 
   -T  :- Set timinig template(Higher Faster)
   -oN :- Output scan in normal
   -oG :- to give filename
   -A  :- Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
   -6  :- Enable IPv6 Scanning
   --open :- Show only open ports
   -sL :- List Scan
   -sn :- Ping Scan
   -v  :- Increase Verbosity level
   -d  :- Debugging
   -oA :- Store output in major 3 format
   --script :- Activate script from nmap scripting library 
 

 TCP Connection 3-Way Handshake :-
  -sT - TCP Connect Scans perform with each target point

  RFC 793 :-
   - If connection not exist then reset sent in response to any incoming segment except another reset
   - SYNs address to non-existent connection rejected by this means
 
  - SYN -> Reset (Port Closed)
  - SYN/ACK 	 (Open)
  - SYN -> Droped show that protected by firewall and port is Filtered
  
  
  -sS - SYN Scan used for Port-ranges of target(Half-open) or (Stealth) scan
  - Default scan run by Nmap if sudo permission
  Advantage    :- Bypass old IDS | Faster than TCP Connect   
  Disadvantage :- Required Sudo Permission because require ability to create raw packet 
  


 UDP Scan :- -sU
  - Send packet and hoping that they make connection
  - Completey empty request
  - No response when packet sent it marked as open | filtered
  - Request is send again for Double-Check and make OPEN 
  - ICMP(Ping) packet return host Unreachable means port Closed
  - Due to this diffculty take 20 min for 1000 port so used :- --top-ports number
  Syntax :- nmap -sU --top-ports 20 <target>
 
 
 
 Null, FIN, XMAS :- -sN | -sF | -sX
  - Null used when TCP request send with no flags set at all
  - FIN send request for close connection
  - Xmas send with PSH, URG, FIN 
  - Port either open|filtered, closed or filtered(ICMP response with Unreachable)
  - Sending request without SYN bypass firewall 
  - Main use of this 3 Firewall Evasion
  - Windows respond with RST for every port
  
  

 ICMP Network Scanning :- 
  - See which IP has Active Host
  ping sweep :- -sn
   - Send ICMP packet to each possible IP address for specified network
   - When send response it means Active Host
   - -sn with IP range with either hypen(-) or CIDR notation
   - Not to scan any ports and rely on ICMP echo packets
   Syntax :- nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254  | 0/254
   
   - ICMP echo cause nmap to send TCP SYN to port 443 and TCP ACK(If not run as root) 80
   CIDR Notation :- Default submask class B -16
   
 
 
 
 NSE(Nmap Scripting Engine) :-
  - Written in LUA progrmming language
  - From Scanning Vulnerability to exploit 
  - Useful for Reconnaisance
  Script Category :-
   safe :- Not affect target
   vuln :- Scan for vulnerabilities
   auth :- Attempt to bypass authentication for running service(Log into FTP server anonymously)
   brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
   Intrusive :- likely affect target
   Exploit   :- Attempt to exploit vulnerability
   Discovery :- Query running service for further information about network(Query SNMP server)
  nmap --script-help <script-name> :- Help that give more information when run locally
  
  --script :- Activating NSE Script
  --script=category / <script-name>
  --script=script1,script2 
  --script-args (, if they're exploiting an authenticated vulnerability)  
  <script-name>.<argument>
  
  http-put :- used to upload files using PUT method(Two args :- URL to upload file to and file location on disk
  Ex :- nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'
  
  
 NSE Store :- 
  - Official Website contain list of offical script
  - Locally stored in linux :- /usr/share/nmap/scripts   | cat scripts.db
 
 
 To install scripts from nmap :- 
  - sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
  - sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse  
  - nmap --script-updatedb 
 
 

 Bypass Firewall Evasion :-
  - Windows by default block all ICMP Packet
  - Nmap always treat target host being alive, bypassing ICMP Block so it takes long times to complete
  - If Host dead Nmap Still checking and double checking specified Port
  -Pn :- Tell Nmap to not bother pinging host before scanning it
  -f  :- Fragement packet into smaller pics to bypass
  --mtu <number> :- Same task perform but provide more control over size of packet | Must be multiple of 8
  --scan-delay <time-ms> :- 
   - Delay between packet sent 
   - Useful when network unstable
   - Evading time-based firewall
  --badsum :-
   - Generate invalid checksum for packet
   - TCP/IP stack drop this packet but firewall potenstially respond automatically without bothering to check
     checksum of packet
